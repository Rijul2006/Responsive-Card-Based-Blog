# 🚀 The Syntax Script | Modern Blog UI

A fully responsive, aesthetically pleasing blog landing page. This project demonstrates advanced CSS techniques including Grid layouts, Flexbox alignment, and interactive hover animations.

##  Key Features
* **Dynamic Grid System:** Uses `grid-template-columns` to switch from 4 columns to a single column based on screen width (1400px, 1050px, and 700px breakpoints).
* **Interactive Card Hover:** Smooth `1s linear` scale transformation that highlights blog posts when a user hovers over them.
* **Modern Background:** A premium three-color linear gradient background that stays fixed as you scroll.
* **Polished Typography:** Uses `text-shadow` for depth on headings and `overflow-wrap` for clean text containment in descriptions.

##  Technical Implementation
* **Layout:** Hybrid approach using **CSS Grid** for the main container and **Flexbox** for internal card alignment (author details and tags).
* **Responsiveness:** Fully mobile-first compatible via media queries.
* **Shadows & Depth:** Utilizes `box-shadow: 5px 5px 20px 5px black` to give the cards a floating effect.

##  File Structure
* `index.html` - Semantic HTML5 structure.
* `style.css` - Custom styles including the responsive grid and animations.
* `images/` - Assets for blog thumbnails and author profile pictures.
